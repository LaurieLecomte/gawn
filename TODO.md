## Features
* Carry the e-values into the transcriptome and genome annotation tables
* Change gene names in GFF3 from ORF to actual gene names from swissprot
- Add CpG annotation (scripts in `01_scripts/future`)

## Documentation

## Validation
- Compare with annotation from a good species that has both a genome and a
  transcriptome
